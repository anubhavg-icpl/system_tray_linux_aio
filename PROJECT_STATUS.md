# System Tray Linux AIO - Project Status

## What We've Accomplished

### ✅ Production-Ready Structure
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with modules for config, error handling, tray, and menu
- **Error Handling**: Custom error types using `thiserror` for robust error management
- **Configuration System**: TOML-based configuration with automatic loading/saving
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging with `tracing` and configurable log levels
- **Async Support**: Built on Tokio for efficient async operations

### ✅ Complete Project Setup
- Proper Cargo.toml with all necessary metadata
- Comprehensive .gitignore
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Unit and integration test structure
- Build configuration for Linux
- Examples directory with basic usage

### ✅ Documentation
- README with features, installation, and usage instructions
- ALOE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE explaining the current state of aloe-system-tray
- Inline documentation and comments explaining the structure

### ⚠️ Current Limitations

The `aloe-system-tray` crate (v0.1.2) has build issues on Linux due to:
1. macOS-specific dependencies (objc-sys, cocoa) that don't have proper feature gates
2. Incomplete translation from C++ (the aloe-rs project is still in progress)

## How to Use This Project

### Option 1: As a Template
Use this project structure as a template for your system tray application. When aloe-system-tray is fixed, simply:
1. Uncomment the aloe dependencies in Cargo.toml
2. Uncomment the aloe imports in the code
3. Remove the placeholder implementations

### Option 2: With Alternative Crates
Replace aloe-system-tray with working alternatives:
```toml
# Instead of aloe-system-tray, use:
tray-icon = "0.21"  # Most popular and stable
# or
ksni = "0.2"        # KDE StatusNotifierItem
```

### Option 3: Contribute to aloe-rs
Help fix the Linux build issues in aloe-system-tray:
1. Fork https://github.com/klebs6/aloe-rs
2. Add proper feature gates for platform-specific code
3. Complete the C++ to Rust translation

## Running the Current Implementation

```bash
# Build
cargo build

# Run (shows placeholder implementation)
cargo run

# Run with debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run

# Run tests
cargo test
```

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for aloe-system-tray fixes**: Monitor the aloe-rs repository for updates
2. **Use alternative crates**: Implement with tray-icon for immediate functionality
3. **Contribute**: Help translate the remaining C++ code in aloe-rs

## Conclusion

This project provides a production-ready foundation for a Linux system tray application. While the aloe-system-tray crate isn't currently compilable on Linux, the structure is designed to easily integrate it once the issues are resolved. The modular design makes it simple to swap in alternative implementations or contribute fixes upstream.
